- Realised that I didn't cater to when the browser has bookmarks tab open. Issue fixed, I hope. Font size looks really small on a phone screen but if I make it bigger it seems to be very badly arranged. 

- I have not discovered any bugs so far. Unless I missed them, because I don't really know how to spot any.
